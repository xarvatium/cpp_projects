# My C++ Projects

Hello, this is where I will upload the C++ projects that I have done. Hope you enjoy and feel free to leave feedback and suggestions (hopefully ones that reduce the libraries I use)


<h2> How to use them: </h2>
1. First off, before you can begin executing the files, you have to compile them. I prefer to use Visual Studio Code as it's easy to work with <br/>
2. Next, you have to install a C++ compiler. What I use is MingW, it's going to take you through a couple of steps but once you're in the installation manager select "mingw32-gcc-g++" or something similar to that, as long as it ends in "g++". After you select that, click "Installation" and choose "Apply Changes" <br/>
3. After you do get the compiler, you have to setup your PATH variable to include where the C++ compiler is. I'm not going to explain it too much because it can be lengthy, so there's a link down below. <br/>
4. Install the Code Runner extension in VS Code, pretty simple, all you do is go into VS Code extensions and search for "Code Runner" by Jun Han and install it <br/>
5. To run the code in Code Runner, press F1 and search for "Run Code" in the bar at the top of the screen <br/>
6. To stop running the code (if in cmd) press Ctrl + C <br/>
