# first_random_num_gen
If you're reading this, then hello, this is my first C++ program I've written. Feel free to point out any mistakes I've made and maybe add some suggestions (hopefully how to lessen the libraries used)

This is a random number generator, pretty simple, I know. I made it cause I just got into C++ and thought I'd give it a shot.

How to use it:
1. First off, you have to compile the .cpp file. The way I do it is with MinGW (link below)
2. Next, you have to add the PATH to MinGW in System Properties (link to show you how to do it is below)
3. Go to the command prompt and change directory to where the .cpp file is (example, if it's on the Desktop then it would be "cd Desktop")
4. In order to compile it, you'd type in "gcc ran_num_gen.cpp"* where you'll get a .exe file
5. If everything went well, you should see the prompt

* "gcc" will differ on what compiler you use, I use Visual Studio Code to negate this however so you may have an easier time with Visual Studio Code
