# My C++ Projects

Hello, this is where I will upload the C++ projects that I have done. Hope you enjoy and feel free to leave feedback and suggestions (hopefully ones that reduce the libraries I use)


<h2> How to use them: </h2>
1. First off, you have to compile the .cpp file. The way I do it is with MinGW (link below)<br/>
2. Next, you have to add the PATH to MinGW in System Properties (link to show you how to do it is below)<br/>
3. Go to the command prompt and change directory to where the .cpp file is (example, if it's on the Desktop then it would be "cd Desktop")<br/>
4. In order to compile it, you'd type in "gcc ran_num_gen.cpp"* where you'll get a .exe file<br/>
5. If everything went well, you should see the prompt<br/>

* "gcc" will differ on what compiler you use, I use Visual Studio Code to negate this however so you may have an easier time with Visual Studio Code
